      <p>Hi,<br><br>
      This is the humble home of the SOUND DESIGN IST course at the KABK by Jakob Schl&ouml;tter.</p>
      <p>You will find here your lessons and code.</p>
      
      <div id="links">

        <h1>Sound Design lesson 1 - 30.03.2016</h1>
        <h2>inspiration</h2>
        
        <h2>assignment</h2>
        <p>I removed the sound of these movie scenes for you: <br />
        - Matthias Steiner (STRONGEST MAN IN THE WORLD)<br />
        - Cropduster (North By Northwest)<br />
        - Arthur Zanetti Artistic Rings Gold<br />
        - Vikings - Bjorn's Grizzly Battle</p>

        <p>My lesson for you is to make a soundscape for these movie scenes, and try to change how they feel.</p>

        <p>Instructions:<br />
        - pic two of the movie scenes (north by north west, strongest man, vikings or olympics)<br />
        - download them <a target="_blank" href="http://officeofhardwork.com/kabk/sounddesign/20160330_videos.zip">here</a><br />
        - rent an audiorecorder for today<br />
        - record sound and noises around the academy that you think fit to the atmosphere of the scene.<br />
        - put your recordings under the scenes and bring them next week.</p>

        <p>Important is here more the atmospheric fit, and NOT the editing. <br />
        Keep the recordings as raw as possible. You should think about how you can influence or control the perception of the scenes, and how much power the sound gives you here. It does not have to be perfect. Your recordings will probably be rough, use that for expression! </p>

        <p>The focus is more on the recordings, but you need some software to glue it to the video.<br>
          Here some suggestions:<br>
          - <a target="_blank" href="http://www.audacityteam.org">Audacity</a>: very good for recording and preparing audio. e.g. noise reduction. downside: not super flexible when adding effects, or composition. - free and open source.<br>
          - <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ardour.org">Ardour</a>: best open source audio editor I've seen so far. Good for composition, animating effects and even imports video. - (free) and open source<br>
        <br>
        This could be e.g.:<br>
          - <a target="_blank" href="http://www.avid.com/pro-tools-first">Pro Tools First</a>: Very solid audio tool. Also available as free version.<br>
          - <a target="_blank" href="http://www.apple.com/nl/logic-pro/">Logic</a>: Also very solid audio tool. Costs a bit.<br>
          - <a target="_blank" href="http://www.apple.com/mac/garageband/">Garage Band</a>: Not many features, but very understandable interface. Costs not much.<br>
          - <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ableton.com">Ableton</a>: Great tool for live music. A bit quirky for editing. Expensive.<br>
          <br>
        If you have already experience in other tools, please feel free to use these instead.<br>
      </p>

        <p>That's it :-)</p>

        <p>We'll discuss your recordings next week then when I'm there, but let me know if you have any questions!</p>

        <p>Have fun!</p>

        - get supercollider running (i'll help you)<br />
        - download these examples <a target="_blank" href="http://themancalledjakob.github.io/sonicExperiments2016Q2/src/cooltweets.scd">here</a><br />
        - download this audiobook <a target="_blank" href="http://themancalledjakob.github.io/sonicExperiments2016Q2/src/kafka.wav">here</a><br>
        - record sounds with supercollider and make a soundscape for the audiobook.<br>
          try to compensate the lack of emotion from the computervoice.<br>
          you are allowed to manipulate the recordings you made or add samples to it.<br>
